# Weather-Dashboard
This is my submission for the module 6 challenge to make a weather dashboard using data from a third party API.

## Description
The following webpage is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 6 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a weather dashboard. Users input the city where they are looking for weather information into the search box. The city is automatically saved into local storage and added to the recent searches. The current weather in the city is displayed at the top of the screen, and the 5-day forcast is presented directly below it. Temperature, wind speed, and humidity are presented numerically and with appropriate units of measurement. An overview of the weather conditions is displayed via a small weather icon. Users may re-search cities that they have previously searched for by clicking the city name button in the recent searches section.
